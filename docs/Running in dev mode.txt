Requirements:
    Java: JDK. I have 1.6.0_24-b07. Java 1.5 may also work, not tested.

    Maven: maven2. I have 2.2.1. Maven 3 may also work, not tested.
        Install maven ubuntu / debian:
            sudo apt-get install maven2

    Eclipse is recommended for development.
        The project files (.classpath, .project, .settings/) are set up for Eclipse Helios SR2.
        You'll also want the M2Eclipse plugin:
            http://m2eclipse.sonatype.org

To setup cassandra (local installation in the repos, for dev, as current user):
    Run this from top dir of repos:
        ./install-cassandra-for-dev.sh  (one-off unless you use 'git clean' as below)
        ./start-cassandra-for-dev.sh    (start or restart; this will stay open and log to console)

    To exit cassandra, just Ctrl+C to kill it.

    This setup runs a localhost (single node) cluster, keeping its data in the repos in gitignored dirs,
    so you can clean everything easily, e.g. using 'git clean -d -X -f'

To run the cassandra cli (console querying / DDL tool): start cassandra as above, then:
    ./cassandra-cli-for-dev.sh

To run the webapp from the commandline:
    mvn jetty:run
then it will be accessible at:
        http://localhost:8080/policy-auction/
