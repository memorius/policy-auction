Requirements:
    Java: JDK. I have 1.6.0_24-b07. Java 1.5 may also work, not tested.

    Maven: maven2. I have 2.2.1. Maven 3 may also work, not tested.
        Install maven ubuntu / debian:
            sudo apt-get install maven2

    Eclipse is recommended for development.
        The project files (.classpath, .project, .settings/) are set up for Eclipse Helios SR2.
        You'll also want the M2Eclipse plugin:
