Requirements:
    Java: JDK. I have 1.6.0_24-b07. Java 1.5 may also work, not tested.

    Maven: maven2. I have 2.2.1. Maven 3 may also work, not tested.
        Install maven ubuntu / debian:
            sudo apt-get install maven2

    Eclipse is recommended for development.
        The project files (.classpath, .project, .settings/) are set up for Eclipse Helios SR2.
        You'll also want the M2Eclipse plugin:
            http://m2eclipse.sonatype.org

    Hector (data access library used to interface to Cassandra):

        - note some info is a little out-of-date and refers to the old Hector APIs before a recent redesign.

To setup cassandra (local installation in the repos, for dev, as current user):
    Run this from top dir of repos:
        ./install-cassandra-for-dev.sh   (one-off unless you use 'git clean' as below)
        ./start-cassandra-for-dev.sh     (start or restart; this will stay open and log to console)
        ./initialize-cassandra-schema.sh (one-off after first startup, unless you use 'git clean' as below)

    To exit cassandra, just Ctrl+C to kill it.

    This setup runs a localhost (single node) cluster, keeping its data in the repos in gitignored dirs,
    so you can clean everything easily, e.g. using 'git clean -d -X -f'

    On linux you may also want to do this, as described here - it will still work without this though:
       http://www.datastax.com/docs/0.8/install/installing#installing-jna

       Edit the file /etc/security/limits.conf, adding the following entries for the user or group that runs Cassandra:
          theusername soft memlock unlimited
          theusername hard memlock unlimited

    You can use jconsole (connect to the CassandraDaemon process) to view its JMX management stuff.

To run the cassandra cli (console querying / DDL tool): start cassandra as above, then:
    ./cassandra-cli-for-dev.sh

To run the webapp from the commandline:
    mvn jetty:run
then it will be accessible at:
    http://localhost:8080/policy-auction/

To run within Eclipse:
    I can't get this to work yet! Should be possible with the "Run Jetty Run" plugin:
        Install the "Run Jetty Run" plugin (http://code.google.com/p/run-jetty-run/)
            in eclipse: search for "Jetty" in the Eclipse Marketplace, or use this update site:
                http://run-jetty-run.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/updatesite
        then use Run Configurations, select Jetty Webapp, click New, enter config
    ...I can get it to launch jetty, but it doesn't seem to start the Tapestry servlet context properly:
        accessing http://localhost:8080/<context> only lists the directory for fileserving, doesn't run Tapestry classes.
